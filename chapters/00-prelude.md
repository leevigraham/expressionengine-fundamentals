Target Audience
---------------

This book is targeted at novice to intermediate developers wishing to learn how to better structure their ExpressionEngine sites. An understanding of ExpressionEngine is required to get the most out of it, however we've tried to link to external resources where possible.

Acknowledgements
----------------

This book is inspired by [Developing Backbone.js Applications](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals). The Panoc build code was taken directly from the Github Repo.
